# Project Title: Exploring the Potential of Reviews Data in Augmented User Experience
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the potential of user reviews data to enhance and augment user experiences. By leveraging insights from reviews, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and actionable feedback that can be used to improve product or service offerings, user engagement, and overall satisfaction.

## Description
User reviews contain valuable information that can be mined to understand user sentiments, preferences, and pain points. This project focuses on:

**Data Analysis:** Quantitative analysis of the dataset
**Augmentation Strategies:** Identifying how insights from reviews can be used to inform product development, enhance user interfaces, and create more personalized user experiences. It is divided into two main parts. In the first part, we will detect relevant topics from reviews, and in the second part, we will extract spans associated with each topic in the reviews.
